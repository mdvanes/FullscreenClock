# Fullscreen Clock

A clock for my laptop screen that I can't really use anyway. Based on https://github.com/DerEnderKeks/FullscreenClock

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file with a browser. Done.

You can find a hosted version [here](https://mdworld.nl/FullscreenClock/).

## But wait! There is more!

Press `f` for full screen mode

### Parameters:
* `bg`: background color
* `fg`: text color

### Examples:
* `index.html?bg=red&fg=blue` - red background and blue text (even if I'd not recommend to use this color combination)
* `index.html?bg=%231A9096&fg=%234D4D4D` - you can use hex colors too
* `index.html?bg=rgb(255,25,0)&fg=rgb(77,77,77)` - or rgb
* `index.html?bg=r&fg=r` - fancy rainbow background/text
